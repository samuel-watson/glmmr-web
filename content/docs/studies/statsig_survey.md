# Survey on the interpretation of statistical significance
The misinterpretation of statistical findings from randomised trials can harm patients. To address this, we are inviting trials unit statisticians to participate in a survey aiming to understand the role statisticians play in the interpretation of statistical findings from randomised trials, particularly the interpretation of non-significant primary outcomes. Participants who take part can choose to enter a prize drawer to win a Â£250 amazon voucher. There is no obligation to participate.

To learn more about this study, see the [Information Sheet](statsig_participant) and the questions which will be asked during the survey.
