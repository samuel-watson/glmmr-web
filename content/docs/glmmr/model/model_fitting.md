# Model fitting
The package offers several methods for maximum likelihood model fitting based around two approaches: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood (MCML) and Laplace approximation. Some of these methods replicate abilities found in other packages and software, which are listed on the software page. A description of the algorithms can be found on the algorithms page, and multiple examples can be found linked in this submenu.
