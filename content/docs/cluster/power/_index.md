# Power calculations
The `glmmrBase` package provides a range of tools to estimate the power of a design to estimate particular model parameters including both quick approximations using the information matrix or by data simulation and model fitting. The pages in this section discuss [approximations](approximations), [data simulation](data simulation), and include a set of examples and a [comparison](comparisons) with commonly used `design effects'.
