# Generalised Linear Mixed Models

{{< columns >}}
## Study design and analysis

Generalised linear mixed models are used to analyse and design a wide variety of experimental study designs. This webpage provides vignettes and resources discussing methods for model fitting, optimal study designs, and more. We focus particularly on cluster randomised trials.

## The `glmmr` packages

We have built the `glmmr` packages for R, which provide a range of methods for generalised linear mixed models. The main package is `glmmrBase`, which provides model fitting using approximate and full likelihood approaches, power calculations, model specification tools, and other functions. `glmmrOptim` provides a set of algorithms for identifying optimal designs. We use these packages and other relevant R packages in these vignettes.
