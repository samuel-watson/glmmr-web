# Generalised Linear Mixed Models

Generalised linear mixed models are used to analyse and design a wide variety of experimental study designs. This webpage provides vignettes and resources discussing methods for model fitting, optimal study designs, and more. Articles are grouped by study type in the menu to the left.


## The `glmmr` packages

We have built the `glmmr` packages for R, which provide a range of methods for generalised linear mixed models. The main package is `glmmrBase`, which provides model fitting using approximate and full likelihood approaches, power calculations, model specification tools, and other functions. `glmmrOptim` provides a set of algorithms for identifying optimal designs. We use these packages and other relevant R packages in these vignettes.
